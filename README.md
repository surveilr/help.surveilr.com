## How to Use This Repository

### 1. Reporting Issues

- Navigate to the "Issues" tab in this repository.
- Click on "New Issue" to create a new report.
- Fill in the issue template, which typically includes:
  - **Title:** A brief summary of the problem.
  - **Description:** Detailed information about the issue, including steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and any relevant screenshots or logs.
  - **Labels:** Optionally, users or support agents can add labels like `bug`, `feature request`, `question`, etc., to categorize the issue.

### 2. Issue Tracking & Management

Support agents are responsible for managing reported issues through the following actions:

- **Assigning Labels:** Categorize issues with relevant labels to indicate their nature (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`).
- **Using Milestones:** Group related issues under milestones to track progress towards larger goals or version releases.
- **Assigning Issues:** Allocate issues to specific support agents based on their expertise or workload.
- **Commenting:** Engage in ongoing communication with end users to gather more information, provide status updates, and clarify any details necessary for resolution.

### 3. Issue Resolution

Once an issue is diagnosed and a solution is implemented:

- The assigned support agent will **close the issue** by updating its status and adding a resolution comment.
- The resolution comment will typically include a summary of the steps taken to resolve the issue, any relevant documentation, and next steps if applicable.
- If the issue persists, users have the option to **reopen the issue** for further investigation.

### 4. Notifications

To keep everyone informed:

- **End users** will receive notifications when their issue is acknowledged, when additional information is required, and when the issue is resolved.
- **Support agents** will be notified when they are assigned to an issue, when there are updates from the user, and when the issue is closed.
